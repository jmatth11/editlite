# Editlite

A simple text editor for learning purposes.

I'm hoping to have simple features of displaying text, scrolling, editing, searching.
I'd also like to have it dynamically load long lines and files so I don't have to load the entire thing in memory at once.

Not sure how configurable I will allow it, but I will try to make it customizable with the basic features.

TODO
- [x] navigating the document.
- [x] Loading more of the file in memory when navigating.
- [x] Edit the document.
    - [x] Handle newlines properly.
    - [ ] Fix bugs with certain edge cases on deleting to previous line and moving to newline
- [ ] Implement "command" mode.
- [ ] Command to load another file.
- [ ] Searching through document.
